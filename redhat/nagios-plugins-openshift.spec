- new-app-and-wait:
  - Expose application over HTTPS in addtion to HTTP.

* Mon Jun 8 2020 Sandro Kaspar <sandro.kaspar@vshn.ch> 0.18.14-1
- check_openshift_pv_avail:
  - Add option to ignore entire storageclasses.

* Tue Oct 1 2019 Manuel Hutter <manuel@vshn.ch> 0.18.13-1
- check_openshift_node:
  - Also check DiskPressure and MemoryPressure.

* Fri Aug 16 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.12-1
- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Timestamps on object conditions, added in version 0.18.10, are removed
    again. They produced a large number of metrics while not answering the
    questions posed.
  - New "running_after" metric on pods calculated for pods which are running
    and which have no restarted containers.

* Wed Aug 14 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.11-1
- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Increase timeout for check command from 1 minute to 5 minutes. On larger
    clusters the evaluation may take more than a minute.

* Mon Aug 5 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.10-1
- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Add "-a" and "-A" options to always output metrics matching given names; by
    default only metrics with limits are output in non-verbose mode.
  - Timestamps of object conditions are reported as individual statistics.

* Thu Jul 11 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.9-1
- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Fractions on the number of pods in a pending, running or other phase are
    calculated relative to the total number of pods in a given scope
    (cluster-global or namespace).

* Mon Jul 8 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.8-1
- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Version 0.18.7 started to emit metrics on how long a pending pod has
    existed. An additional metric was generated for unscheduled pods. These
    would usually show up alongside a "pending for too long" alert which is
    redundant. With this version a pod is either "pending" or "unscheduled",
    but not both.

* Fri Jul 5 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.7-1
- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Version 0.18.6 introduced "pending.slow" and "pending.unscheduled" metrics.
    As it turned out these weren't too useful, in particular due to the
    hardcoded delay of 5 minutes. With this version the metrics are changed to
    emit the amount of time since an object was created combined
    ("project.foo.pod.bar-1.creation.elapsed") with, for pods, the phase
    ("project.foo.pod.bar-1.pending.elapsed") and whether they're unscheduled
    ("project.foo.pod.bar-1.unscheduled.elapsed").

* Tue Jul 2 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.6-1
- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Additional metrics are produced for pods in "pending" phase:
    "pending.unscheduled" for any unscheduled pods and "pending.slow" for pods
    in such a state for more than 5 minutes.

* Mon Jun 17 2019 Gabriel Mainberger <gabriel.mainberger@vshn.ch> 0.18.5-1
- new-app-and-wait:
  - Add workaround for service account token generation is delayed.

* Thu Jun 6 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.4-1
- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Ignore failed count when determining whether Job succeeded.

* Tue May 28 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.2-1
- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Emit object deletion timestamp as metric.

* Fri May 24 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.1-1
- check_openshift_es_stats:
  - Actually report JVM heap stats, used to be filesystem stats since version
    0.18.0.
  - Report usage of non-heap memory in JVM and JVM garbage collectors metrics.

* Wed Apr 17 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.18.0-1
- check_openshift_es_stats:
  - Avoid division by zero.
  - Large overhaul of code structure to use loops instead of code repetition
    with minor changes.
  - Add statistics on available space as the opposite of used space, enabling
    easier monitoring across clusters of different sizes.

- check_openshift_es_stats:
  - Gather cluster-wide statistics and allow application of limits.

* Tue Apr 9 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.17.5-2
- Patch Python programs to explicitly invoke "/usr/bin/python3.4" instead of
  "/usr/bin/python3" to handle differences in the installed default Python
  version.

* Fri Mar 29 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.17.5-1
- check_openshift_es_stats:
  - Use Elasticsearch instance name as metric suffix.
  - Strip "logging-es-data-master-" and "logging-es-" prefixes from instance
    name.

* Thu Mar 21 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.17.4-1

  - Return "OK" status when there are no metrics.

* Wed Feb 6 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.17.3-1
- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Output only metrics with defined limits or an unhealthy status.

- check_openshift_object_stats:
  - Add verbose mode for easier debugging.
  - Compute more statistics for cron jobs.

* Thu Jan 31 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.17.1-1
- check_openshift_object_stats: Support additional "-n" parameter to specify
  namespace. By default objects from all namespaces are retrieved.

* Tue Jan 29 2019 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.17.0-1
- check_openshift_object_stats: New plugin to compute object statistics based
  on "check_openshift_project_pod_phase". The latter will be removed in an
  upcoming version.

- Switch from custom "sudo" check command wrapper to
  "nagios-plugins-sudo-config" package.

* Wed Dec 5 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.15.4-1

  - Collect more logs on completion (regardless of failure).

- pv_avail:
  - Changed terminology for volumes with undefined storage class from "default
    class" to "without storage class".

* Fri Nov 23 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.15.3-1
- pod_node_alloc:
  - Changed decision logic to only complain if either >50% or >3 of pods are on
    a single node. This way three-replica deployments are considered okay if
    they have two pods on a single node.

* Thu Nov 15 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.15.2-1
- node_log_heartbeat:
  - Change part of the Elasticsearch filter from "term" to "match" query to
    support differences in fields between OpenShift Origin 3.9 and OpenShift
    Container Platform 3.9.

* Wed Nov 14 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.15.1-1
- node_log_heartbeat:
  - Add unit-of-measurement to metrics
  - Emit log timestamps as metrics

* Mon Nov 12 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.15.0-1
- Removed "logging-wrapper" script as it didn't work on RHEL/CentOS.
- Added new script named "check_openshift_node_log_heartbeat" to check
  Elasticsearch for recent timestamp written to logs on all nodes.

* Mon Aug 6 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.14.3-1
- project_pod_phase:
  - Metric descriptions have been amended with more details.
- new-app-and-wait:
  - Client and server versions are output for logging.
  - Deployment logs are collected before project removal.
  - Avoid triggering deployment explicitly ("oc deploy") and rely on default
    triggers instead.
  - Only projects with configured prefix ("e2e" by default) are removed, not
    all visible to the end-to-end test user.

* Tue Jun 19 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.14.2-1
- Fix a bug introduced in version 0.14.1: Selector arguments for check commands
  were silently skipped. Only a warning was logged.

* Mon Jun 18 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.14.1-1
- Icinga check command "openshift_node_resources": Replace lambdas in "skip_if"
  with direct access to runtime macros. Now arguments are passed onto the check
  script even if they're not a string.

* Fri May 4 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.14.0-1
- check_openshift_pv_avail: The selector options "-l" and "-s" now support an
  optional storage class, separated from the value by a comma. To retain the
  existing selection behaviour they apply to all classes by default. Metrics
  are grouped by storage class and storage classes are included in
  human-readable output.
- check_openshift_pvc_phase: Show the storage class for pending and lost volume
  claims. Fail with a critical state when a claim is older than an hour.
- Fix typo in "openshift_pod_count" command definition: the
  "openshift_pod_count_crit" Icinga2 variable would overwrite the parameter for
  setting the warning limit.

* Fri Apr 27 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.13.1-1
- Expose count over all pod phases in "check_openshift_project_pod_phase" as
  Icinga2 variable.

* Thu Apr 26 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.13.0-1
- Add "check_openshift_project_pod_phase" script to observe pod phase (pending,
  running, etc.) of all pods on a cluster.

* Wed Apr 4 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.12.4-1
- new-app-and-wait: The upstream code for "oc new-app" can leave a clone of the
  application source behind in a temporary directory. Explicitly specify
  a temporary directory which is then removed by the wrapper code.

* Tue Apr 3 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.12.3-1
- check_openshift_pvc_phase: Show requested size, volume name and bound
  capacity for pending and lost claims.

* Thu Mar 22 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.12.2-1
- Install "new-app-and-wait" script.
- Update openshift-origin-client-tools dependency to require version 3.7.2 or
  newer.

* Mon Mar 5 2018 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.12.1-1
- check_openshift_node_fluentd: Check all nodes, not only those marked
  schedulable

- Initial version with most checks working on CentOS and RHEL.

* Tue Jul 4 2017 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.11.4-1
- List remaining days in output of "check_openshift_cert_expiry_report".

* Mon Jul 3 2017 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.11.7-1
- Add "check_openshift_cert_expiry_report" to evaluate result of
  openshift-ansible certificate report.

* Tue Jan 3 2017 Michael Hanselmann <hansmi@vshn.ch> 0.10.0-1
- Initial release for RedHat (only the Icinga configuration works)
